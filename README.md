This is a social media I have been developing
It uses express for the backend server and mongodb for its database
It uses react and tailwindcss for its frontend and axios for endpoint calls
Until this initial commit to github it has taken me around a week to complete what is here
im very proud of this project it gives me confidence in what i know and love
From here on my objective is to fix the backend which is a cluster and messy, but to also get it ready for vercel
the next part of my objective is to create an algorithm that can reccommend posts to people, i do not have enough data just yet tho
thats all for now.
